  <h2>Book Review</h2>
  <p>My Favorite book I've read is Beyonders: A World Without Heroes. The book takes place on Earth in the first few chapters and soon after, the setting is moved to a fantasy world named Lyrian. The main characters, Jason and Rachel embark on an epic adventure throughout Lyrian, meeting new people and making new friends. Their end goal is to defeat the evil man ruling the land, Maldor.</p>

  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>The main character, Jason, is an average high-schooler until he is teleported to the world of Lyrian via a hippo in the zoo. During his travels in Lyrian, he is trying to find all the syllables that will destroy the evil lord Maldor. The other main character, Rachel, is good friends with Jason. She got to Lyrian via an archway in Arizona. She helps out Jason in defeating the evil overlord.</p>
