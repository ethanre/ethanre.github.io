  <h2>Book Review</h2>
  <p><p>My Favorite book I've read is Beyonders: A World Without Heroes. The book takes place on Earth in the first few chapters and soon after, the setting is moved to a fantasy world named Lyrian. The main characters, Jason and Rachel embark on an epic adventure throughout Lyrian, meeting new people and making new friends. Their end goal is to defeat the evil man ruling the land, Maldor.</p>
