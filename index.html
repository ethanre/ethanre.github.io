  <h1>I'm Ethan Reidel and I attend CCA</h1>

  <p>And this is my website</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sduhsd.net/"></a></p>

<p>My name is Ethan Reidel and I am 15 years old. My hobbies include playing tennis, building and using computers and playing the piano. I played varsity tennis at CCA last year and I'm going to tryout this year. I built my first computer two years ago and plan to build more in the coming future. This summer, I played over 150 hours of tennis.</p>
