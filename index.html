<p>My name is Ethan Reidel and I am 15 years old. My hobbies include playing tennis, using computers and playing the piano. I played varsity tennis at CCA last year and I'm going to tryout this year. I built my first computer two years ago and plan to build more in the coming future. This summer, I played over 150 hours of tennis.</p>
