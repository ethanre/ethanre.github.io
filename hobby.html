  <h1>My Hobby</h1>
</div>

  <p>My main hobby is playing video games and using my computer. I enjoy doing these things because they take me away from the stresses of life so I can relax. I usually play games with my close friends because it provides an improved experience. The main platform I use to play games is Steam, created by Gabe Newell.</p>
